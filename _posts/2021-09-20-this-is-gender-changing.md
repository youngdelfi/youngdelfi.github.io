<p>This week I went back and forth to Buenos Aires, spent time with friends and thought about gifts for my brother and my dad</strong>, who both celebrate their birthdays a few days apart.</p><p>Last time I shared with you the <strong>concept of sexuality as a spectrum</strong>. I also said one's sexuality consisted of many aspects. If we spread out some of those aspects on a diagram, it would look like this:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-804-1024" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b4591b1-6057-4f0a-82c7-140e8bc98876_1024x804.jpeg"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b4591b1-6057-4f0a-82c7-140e8bc98876_1024x804.jpeg" width="1024" height="804" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6b4591b1-6057-4f0a-82c7-140e8bc98876_1024x804.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:804,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Diagram of Sex and Gender – cultural bridges to justice&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="Diagram of Sex and Gender – cultural bridges to justice" title="Diagram of Sex and Gender – cultural bridges to justice"><style>

It refers to how we’re expected to act, speak, dress, groom, and conduct ourselves based upon our assigned sex.</strong> For example, if you’re born female (sex), you are expected to behave like a woman (gender). We are used to believing that anyone born a female should, <em>by definition</em>, act in certain ways - feminine ways - to express their assigned gender. Women should play with baby dolls, feed them, take care of them, be sweet and dress nicely. Men should play with swords and action figures, demonstrate strength, vitality and courage. <a href="https://www.genderequalitylaw.org/examples-of-gender-stereotypes">Here’s a list of some other gender stereotypes</a>.</p><p><strong>Therefore, gender is a social construction</strong>. <em>Expectations</em> are <em>assigned</em> to us in relation to our <em>sex, </em>which was also <em>assigned</em> by someone (i.e.: doctors at childbirth). If doctors say it’s a female, people unconsciously assign the gender (woman) to that baby. <strong>There’s an - almost - unquestionable connection between female-woman and male-man.</strong> <em>Of course that anyone born a female will act like a woman, and anyone born a male will act like a man, right?</em></p><p>Up until now, I’ve explained how most people see the world.
