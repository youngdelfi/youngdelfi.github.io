<p><strong>I spent last weekend biking around Buenos Aires</strong>. It’s been a long time since I did that, and I believe it's the best way to know the city (other than riding a motorbike). Biking around I greeted a fellow motorbiker with a 1983 Honda 900 manufactured in Japan. You don't see those nowadays. On Sunday I came back to Ing. Maschwitz and inmediately felt at ease with the open spaces and nature.</p><p><strong>My goal for this week was to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CZDFJQR">sell my book online</a></strong>. I intend to work on a few remaining details this weekend.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-1504-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fad8e866f-2326-4b63-b5f0-ef49a7f07d6e_3024x3123.jpeg"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ad8e866f-2326-4b63-b5f0-ef49a7f07d6e_3024x3123.jpeg" width="1456" height="1504" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ad8e866f-2326-4b63-b5f0-ef49a7f07d6e_3024x3123.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:1504,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:2757575,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

I turned desperately to a dear friend of me - who happens to be a lesbian -  and asked her: "<em>I like women, but I'm not sure what would that make me? a lesbian, a bisexual? so all this time I've been with guys was a lie?</em>"</p><p>She told me: "<em>No, it wasn't. <strong>Sexuality is a spectrum</strong>. You can go from one side to the other however you want, whenever you want, without it defining you</em>".</p><p><strong>I identify with being bisexual now - that doesn't mean I can feel a different way someday</strong>. I liked being with guys - I'd like to be with guys now too. I just choose to partner with a woman because that's what calls me now. Does that mean I'm a lesbian? I don't know, I don't care too much.</p><p>There are women who've told me they've wanted to be with a girl - that's great. That doesn't change who they are. In fact, perhaps fulfilling that desire leads them to actually <strong>be</strong> who they truly are.</p><p>So, sexuality is a spectrum. <strong>But, what does sexuality mean?</strong></p><p>Sexuality consists of many different aspects, such as a one’s sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation and sexual behavior.</p><p><strong>In this email, I'll start by explaining sex.</strong></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-971-1456" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63c3de57-4642-4e55-9317-33b8c24b637f_2473x1650.png"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63c3de57-4642-4e55-9317-33b8c24b637f_2473x1650.png" width="1456" height="971" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/63c3de57-4642-4e55-9317-33b8c24b637f_2473x1650.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:971,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Visualizing Sex as a Spectrum - Scientific American Blog Network&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="Visualizing Sex as a Spectrum - Scientific American Blog Network" title="Visualizing Sex as a Spectrum - Scientific American Blog Network"><style>

Factors that determine sex are <strong>mostly visible</strong>, such as external sex organs (penis, vulva, testicles) and secondary sex characteristics that appear in puberty such as facial hair and breasts. Genes, chromosomes, hormones and internal sex organs are less visible but also determine a person's sex.</p><p><strong>We usually think of sex as binary: either you're male or female. If you're female, then you can't be male, and vice-versa</strong>. Each option excludes one another, quite what Aristotle says in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_excluded_middle">Law of the excluded third</a>.</p><p>Now, suppose a baby is born. It has a really big clitoris, almost like a penis. Is it female? Is it male? The complexity increases: a genetic test reveals the baby has XX chromosomes (female), but the external sex organs don’t look exactly male or female.</p><p><strong>Can this happen?</strong></p><p><strong>It can. And it does.</strong></p><p>There are several disorders of sex development (DSDs), leading to a whole bunch of intersex people that aren’t male or female. <strong>Between 1% and 2% of the population in the world is intersex</strong> - just about the percentage of people with red hair. <em>Have you seen a redhead?</em> <strong>Chances are you've met an intersex person but probably didn't notice</strong>.</p><p>There's, for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia">Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</a>, where external sex organs might point out a person is male/female but the internal sex organs might tell otherwise. Another DSD is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome">Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome</a>, which Australian filmmaker Phoebe Hart depicts in her auto-biographical documentary <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchids,_My_Intersex_Adventure">Orchids</a></em>.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-379-570" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9034fc0-7f8b-4a9e-a5e8-0063d69336e8_900x598.jpeg"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9034fc0-7f8b-4a9e-a5e8-0063d69336e8_900x598.jpeg" width="570" height="378.73333333333335" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/b9034fc0-7f8b-4a9e-a5e8-0063d69336e8_900x598.jpeg&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:598,&quot;width&quot;:900,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:570,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Orchids: My Intersex Adventure | Women Make Movies&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt="Orchids: My Intersex Adventure | Women Make Movies" title="Orchids: My Intersex Adventure | Women Make Movies"><style>

What happens then?</p><p><strong>Under a binary way of understanding sex, ambiguity just can't exist</strong>. Every human being has to unmistakably be identified with one of the two sexes (male or female). Doctors encourage the parents to surgically "correct" the baby's sex organs to fit into a category, even though there's no health risk. The parents don’t know anything about DSDs and don’t know who to ask, so they accept and the baby undergoes surgery to fit into medical and social standards. <strong>The baby doesn't make any decision over its body. </strong></p><p>Let's suppose now that another baby is born with the same ambiguous sex organs. This time, doctors and parents know that sex is non-binary and they are aware of DSDs. <strong>Doctors don't suggest to surgically intervene the baby to be male/female</strong> because there's no actual risk for the baby to be born that way. Parents start raising the baby with information and support from communities. <strong>Later on, the baby grows and makes its own decisions.</strong></p><p><strong>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/young-people-on-how-they-found-out-they-are-intersex">most intersex people aren’t treated this way</a></strong>. Information is key to change our mindsets and allow them to decide what happens to their bodies.</p><p>I'll end it here for now.</p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Delfi</p><div><hr></div><h3>Have feedback or comments?</h3><p>It’s all a work in progress, so I’d love to know what you think.
