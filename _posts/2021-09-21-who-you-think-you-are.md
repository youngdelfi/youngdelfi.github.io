<p>This week I enjoyed a few sunny days, did some exercise, met my mom for coffee and got my second Covid-19 vaccine. <strong>Seems unreal.</strong></p><p>Last time, we started tackling the complexity surrounding gender, and mentioned gender identity and gender expression. Let's dive into those terms.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Gender identity</strong>&nbsp;is one's own internal sense of self and their gender, whether that is man, woman, neither or both (how can you be neither or both? ). It is not outwardly visible to others.</p></blockquote><p>Everyone, consciously or unconsciously, identifies with a gender. Do you think you fit better in the role of a woman? or a man, or both? does neither feel right to you? In case you’re wondering how can someone feel outside of the gender norms completely, I used to wonder that as well. It’s a topic I’ll cover in future emails.</p><p>The important thing to know right now is that gender identity can change over time, and that nobody else can know how we perceive ourselves.</p><p>On the other hand…</p><blockquote><p><strong>Gender expression </strong>is how a person presents gender outwardly, through behavior, clothing, voice or other perceived characteristics. Society identifies these cues as masculine or feminine, although what is considered masculine or feminine changes over time and varies by culture.</p></blockquote><p>In a few words, gender expression is what we often “use” to express our self-perceived gender identity, so that it can be understood externally by other people.</p><p>For some people, their gender identity corresponds with the gender assigned at birth. <strong>For others, it does not, and they might suffer from gender dysphoria: a sense of unease that a person may have because of a mismatch between their biological sex and their gender identity</strong>. This sense of unease or dissatisfaction may be so intense it can lead to depression and anxiety and have a harmful impact on daily life.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 image2-373-450" target="_blank" href="https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5dde779c-9534-4ebf-9c52-74ebf9672a39_1132x936.png"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5dde779c-9534-4ebf-9c52-74ebf9672a39_1132x936.png" width="450" height="372.08480565371025" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/5dde779c-9534-4ebf-9c52-74ebf9672a39_1132x936.png&quot;,&quot;height&quot;:936,&quot;width&quot;:1132,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:450,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null}" alt=""><style>

If we did not know by now that sex and gender are independent from each other, <strong>we would automatically assume his gender is boy/man because he was born a male</strong>. Let's pretend for a moment that we don't know that, so we expect him to act masculine to live up to the socially constructed gender <strong>we assigned to him (gender attribution)</strong>.</p><p>We go to the toy store. There is a section for boys and another for girls. The boy section looks tough - greyish and blue, there are trucks, action figures, cars... Whereas the girl section has more pink, there are dresses, glitter, and dolls. We don't question why there's a different section for each gender, nor who determined that blue is for boys and pink is for girls. That is gender too.</p><p>Do we know if the 5-year old would like to play with trucks, or would he like to dress like a princess? We don't. But we don't ask that to ourselves because he's <em>a boy and boys should act masculine.</em> We take the truck.</p><p>The 5-year old grows up. <strong>He feels like a woman, he identifies with that gender (gender identity)</strong>. <strong>He starts to express that gender acting feminine (gender expression)</strong>. He grows his hair long, he wears dresses, he paints his nails and wears make up (to say a few things associated to acting feminine). He asks people to call him by the pronoun "she/her", so from now on we call her that way. <strong>People still see her like a man because she has a beard, no breasts, and male sex organs (gender attribution)</strong>. She undergoes surgeries and aesthetical procedures to better express to society her gender identity until she looks like a woman (gender expression). <strong>People then change their gender attribution:</strong> she now looks like a woman and acts like a woman - she must be a woman. Or at least, she's not a man.</p><p>We’ll talk more about <strong>gender identities that don’t match the usual woman/man binarism</strong> in future emails. In the meantime, you can easily go through this <a href="https://www.genderbread.org/">super </a><em><a href="https://www.genderbread.org/">digestible</a></em><a href="https://www.genderbread.org/"> resource</a> that explains gender identity as continuums (and with a gingerbread person).</p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Delfi</p><div><hr></div><h3>Have feedback or comments?</h3><p>It’s all a work in progress, so I’d love to know what you think.
